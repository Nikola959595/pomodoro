Hello! This simple program is an implementation of a time 
managment technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in 
the late 1980s. The steps in the techique are deciding
on the task that should be done, setting a timer 
(usually 25 minutes), working on the task for that
amount of time, taking a 5 minute breaking and repeating
this 4 times taking a longer break (usually 20 minutes).

Pomodoro means tomato in Italian, and this method was
named after a tomato shaped kitchen timer!

Happy working!
